# CDM-Project1-Demo

This is the code for a demo/draft of the image project for Composing Digital Media. A black and white, blurry image can be seen and as the user hovers over the image with their mouse, there is a sharper, colorful circle. The idea is to comment on our limited attention span meeting the chaos of our busy daily lives.
