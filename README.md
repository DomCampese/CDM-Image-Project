# Attention Simulator

This is the code for the final version of the image project for Composing Digital Media. A black and white, blurry image can be seen and as the user hovers over the image with their mouse, there is a sharper, colorful circle. The circle additionally changes size alternating between a max and minimum radius to show a change in attention over time. There are also multiple scenes where this affect is displayed that the user can cycle through.
